#Welcome to Drafts

**Drafts** is the _rich text editor_ for web writers.

Write your thoughts in the editor box using the toolbar to give nice format to your text, then go to the "plain" tab to see and copy the `HTML` or `Markdown` output of your text.

## Formats

Right now  Drafts editor supports the following formats:

### Inline formats

- Bold: `<strong>`.
- Italics: `<em>`.
- Strikethrough `<del>`.
- Underline `<ins>`.
- Inline code `<code>`.
- Links `<a>`.

### Block  formats

- Normal: (default format) a simple `<p>` paragraph.
- Headings: levels from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
- Unordered lists: `<ul>`.
- Ordered lists: `<ol>`.
- Blockquotes: `<blockquote>`.
- Code blocks: `<pre>`.

## Manage your drafts

You can save your drafts locally and continue editing later by picking the document you want to edit from the list of saved documents _"My drafts"_ in the menu.

To delete a draft just click the _"delete"_ button (Deleted drafts can't be recovered).

## Start writting

Create a new draft going to the menu and clicking the big'ol "New draft" button and start writting for the web.

## Credits

Drafts is made by [Erwin Larios](https://github.com/erwinandres) using a modified version of [React Rich Text Editor](https://github.com/sstur/react-rte) wich is built on top of [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/), an awsome React plugin for creating rich text editors.

## TODO

- Support images.
- Emojis.
- Word count.
- Autosave? (I hate autosave). Maybe save on `Ctrl+S`.
